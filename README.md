# 10_question_game
It is a simple python programe that runs the user through 10 questions and accumulate the result to show the total. 
It has a set of questions to run thruogh and because this is a biginner project, if the user does not put the right answer, the program takes it as a wrong answer
Addiionally, it is my first project solo so please enjoy
